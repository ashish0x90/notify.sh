Notify.sh 
=========

Notify.sh is a collection of helper scripts to turn vanilla shell scripts into more awesome and more friendly.

Use cases
---------
- Enable conditional runtime breakpoints for scripts to check if a step passed/failed.
- Based on result of the step send out notification (e-mail,twitter etc).
- Optionally Suspend/Resume the script if error occurs, without user have to continously monitor it's status.
- Define Cleanup functions after the script gets completed/error occurs.
